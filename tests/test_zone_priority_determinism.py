"""Overlapping plane zones must fill DETERMINISTICALLY, and the oracle must
survive a net whose only copper is vias.

Both defects were found together on usp_obc_v7 (set19), where an A/B reported
"1 net unconnected, completion 100% -> 97.8%" over copper that was
BIT-IDENTICAL between the two runs -- a phantom regression:

  1. route_planes' Voronoi cells are NOT guaranteed disjoint: In1.Cu came out
     with the whole Net-(U5-GND) pour nested inside the GND cell, both at the
     default priority 0. KiCad fills higher-priority zones first and only
     lower-priority zones pull back, so equal-priority overlapping zones have
     no defined winner -- it tie-breaks on the zones' KIIDs, i.e. their UUIDs.
     We mint a fresh uuid4 per zone per run, so the FILL moved between runs:
     the same board graded "1 net unconnected" on 4 of 6 UUID rolls. Emitting
     DISTINCT priorities removes the ambiguity at the source (verified: link
     count went from {32,33} across 8 UUID rolls to a constant 32).

  2. kicad_oracle._net_track_components returned bare [] label lists on its
     no-component paths while still returning the populated `vias` list.
     Callers index them by enumerate() position (`comp_of_via[j]`), so any net
     with vias but NO segments -- Net-(U5-GND): 2 vias, 2 pads, fed entirely
     by zone fill -- raised IndexError. That took down exact_clusters(), so
     the DETERMINISTIC pcbnew link source (#490) fell back to kicad-cli, and
     it took down oracle_reconnect() outright, killing route_disconnected_
     planes before its .kicad_pro writeback -- after which the board graded
     against the stock netclass and sprouted 48 phantom violations (#441).
