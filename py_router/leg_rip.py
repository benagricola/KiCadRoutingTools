"""Leg-level (partial) rip-up -- rip only the branch that is actually in the way (#510).

When `route.py` rips a blocker to make room it tears out the ENTIRE net, even
when only one leg of a multi-tap net ever obstructed the route. Measured on the
corpus, every rip on five sampled boards was on a multipoint net, and ~65-85% of
the torn-out copper belonged to legs that were never in the way.

This module answers the one question that makes a partial rip possible:

    given the cells that blocked the route, WHICH of the blocker net's copper
    is actually responsible?

The router already computes those cells (`blocked_cells`, from the A* frontier)
and then aggregates them away to a per-net count in `analyze_frontier_blocking`
/ `_identify_blocking_obstacles`. That aggregation is the only reason the rip has
to be whole-net -- the geometry is still right there in `pcb_data`.

WHY GEOMETRY, NOT RECORDED LEG IDS. Phase 3 already slices each tap's copper out
of the flat list (`completed_result['new_segments'][len(lm_segments):]`), so leg
boundaries exist at commit time and could be recorded. But length matching
REPLACES main-path segments after the fact, so recorded ids would have to be
maintained through every later mutation. Deriving the branch from the net's
current copper is immune to that -- it reads what is actually on the board now.

BRANCH, NOT BARE SEGMENTS. Removing only the offending segments would free the
corridor but leave dangling stubs mid-net. Instead we walk the net's segment
graph out from each offending segment and take the whole maximal chain whose
interior points have degree 2, stopping at junctions (degree != 2) and via
locations. That is exactly one "leg"/tap of the tree: other branches keep their
copper, and the re-route reconnects the orphaned component.

The re-route needs no new machinery: `route_multipoint_main` already derives
`pad_components` from EXISTING copper (`get_terminal_component_info`) and routes
only the MST edges needed to join disconnected components -- it even short-
circuits with "All pads already connected by existing copper". A partially
ripped net re-queued for routing therefore reconnects just the missing leg.

Gated by KICAD_LEG_RIP=1; default OFF, so the whole-net path is unchanged.

#     the reconnect does not recover them all;
#   * it was pathologically SLOW -- 1204ms inside ONE call vs 327ms worst case,
#     because tripling r makes the (2r+1)^2 dilation ~8x bigger.
